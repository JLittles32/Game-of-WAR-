This is my project for making the card game WAR! It will deal out the cards to two players and subsequently keep dealing cards until there are no more and there is a winner. Each player will play their hands and the player with the highest card will be awarded the point, which the program will keep track of and display the total at the end of the game. 
I used Eclipse to make this project. 
It was a fun project and challenging. I was proud that I was able to figure out how to get the deck to shuffle and also how to add the points up and declare a winner at the end of the game. It was difficult to come up with the solutions being new at this but rewarding when it worked. 
All you need to do to play is hit the run button and it will do all the work for you.
